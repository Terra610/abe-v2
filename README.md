## 📌 What A.B.E. Is
**A.B.E. (American Butterfly Effect)** is a *local-only*, *privacy-preserving*, *constitutional divergence engine* designed to audit:

- state statutes  
- police powers  
- administrative conduct  
- funding compliance  
- constitutional alignment  
- FMCSR misuse  
- rights violations  
- economic impacts of overreach  

All processing occurs **on the user's device only**.  
**No servers. No tracking. No external storage.**

---

## 🎯 Purpose
> **To restore constitutional fidelity and expose the cascading economic damage caused by unlawful state overreach.**

A.B.E. gives citizens, attorneys, journalists, economists, and policy leaders a structured tool to identify:

- when states exceed statutory authority  
- when enforcement violates constitutional limits  
- when FMCSRs are misapplied  
- when rights are infringed  
- when funding rules are broken  
- when economic loss is created  

A.B.E. turns those fractures into **structured, defensible evidence.**

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **User uploads or enters intake data**  
   — stored only in the browser, never online.

2. **Engine converts intake to a standard schema**

3. **Audit modules run independently**, including:
   - Police Power / Statutory Limits  
   - Jurisdiction  
   - FMCSR Applicability  
   - Due Process Violations  
   - Federal Preemption  
   - Spending Clause Compliance  
   - Divergence Scoring  

4. **Output**  
   A structured divergence record with:
   - statutory violations  
   - case law conflicts  
   - constitutional breaches  
   - funding exposure  
   - economic loss modeling
